# text = He said that a meeting may and ought to be prevented if, in the opinion formed by rational men, it is likely to lead to a breach of tranquillity in the neighbourhood; or, secondly, if the objects of the meeting are unlawful; but whether such objects actually exist must be decided from the surrounding facts and circumstances, of which the place of meeting is an important element.
